##  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Cloud Project with Gmail API and Google Sheets API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 Desktop Application credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Gmail2Sheet-Assignment
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows PowerShell
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure OAuth credentials**
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable Gmail API and Google Sheets API
   - Configure OAuth 2.0 (Desktop Application)
   - Download credentials and place at `credentials/credentials.json`

5. **Update configuration**
   - Edit `config.py` and add your Google Sheet ID
   - Ensure your Google Sheet has headers: `From | Subject | Date | Content`

6. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

##  OAuth Flow

**OAuth 2.0 Desktop Flow** is used for authentication:

1. User authenticates via browser on first run
2. Access and refresh tokens stored locally in `token.json`
3. Tokens are reused across runs to avoid repeated login
4. Tokens regenerated only when switching Gmail accounts

**Why this approach?**
- Works with personal Gmail accounts (service accounts not allowed for Gmail API)
- Secure and industry-standard
- User-friendly with token persistence

**Scopes Used:**
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` - Read and modify Gmail
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` - Read and write Sheets

---

##  Duplicate Prevention Logic

The system prevents duplicates through a multi-layered approach:

1. **Unread Email Filter**: Only processes unread emails from Inbox
2. **Timestamp-based State**: Stores last processed email timestamp in `state.json`
3. **Mark as Read**: After successful processing, emails are marked as READ
4. **Incremental Processing**: On re-run, only emails newer than stored timestamp are considered

**Flow:**
- First run: Processes all unread emails, saves newest timestamp
- Subsequent runs: Only processes emails newer than saved timestamp
- Result: Idempotent execution with zero duplicates

---

##  State Persistence Method

State is stored in a local JSON file (`state.json`):

```json
{
  "last_timestamp": 1737183456789
}
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Lightweight (no database required)
- ✅ Easy to debug and verify
- ✅ Reliable across script re-runs
- ✅ File excluded from version control (`.gitignore`)

The timestamp represents the internal date of the last processed email (Unix epoch in milliseconds), ensuring chronological ordering and preventing reprocessing.

##  Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. OAuth Scope Issues
**Problem:** Initial OAuth token allowed Gmail access but failed when writing to Google Sheets (403 insufficient scopes).

**Solution:** Combined Gmail and Sheets scopes into a single OAuth flow and regenerated the token, ensuring one access token had permission for both APIs.

### 2. Python Import Errors
**Problem:** Assignment required `config.py` outside `src/`, causing module import errors.

**Solution:** Dynamically added project root to Python's path using `sys.path.append()` to maintain required structure without refactoring.

### 3. Google Sheets Cell Size Limitation
**Problem:** Some emails exceeded Google Sheets' 50,000-character cell limit.

**Solution:** Truncated email bodies to 30,000 characters before insertion and converted HTML to plain text for better readability.

### 4. HTML Emails as Raw Markup
**Problem:** Many emails were logged as raw HTML, reducing readability.

**Solution:** Implemented HTML → plain text conversion using BeautifulSoup before appending content to Sheets.

---

##  Limitations

- Only processes emails from **Inbox** (not Promotions/Spam folders)
- Subject filter keyword (`invoice`) is currently **hardcoded**
- Email content is **truncated** to 30k characters to comply with Google Sheets limits
- Designed for **single-user** Gmail account (multi-account support not implemented)
- Requires manual OAuth consent on first run

---

##  Features Implemented

### Mandatory Features ✅
- Gmail API integration with OAuth 2.0
- Google Sheets API integration
- Email parsing (From, Subject, Date, Content)
- Duplicate prevention via state persistence
- Secure credential handling (no secrets committed)

### Bonus Features ⭐
- ✅ Subject-based filtering (processes only emails containing "Invoice")
- ✅ HTML → plain text conversion using BeautifulSoup
- ✅ Logging with timestamps (written to `app.log`)
